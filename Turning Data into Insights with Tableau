📊 Turning Data into Insights with Tableau
I recently completed a Tableau presentation that covered the entire data journey — from connecting to multiple sources, preparing and cleaning data, to building powerful visualizations and dashboards.
I worked with live and extract connections, explored chart types like bar📊, line📈, pie🔴, donut⭕, packed bubbles🔵, and maps 🗺️, and combined them into a dashboard 📊designed to communicate insights clearly.
Tableau’s drag-and-drop interface and interactive visuals make it easier to turn complex data into actionable insights that drive better decisions.
